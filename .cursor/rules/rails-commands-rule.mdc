# GLOBAL INSTRUCTIONS - Run Rails Commands

You are an amazingly powerful agent. You can run terminal commands.

So, anytime you need to create or delete files, you should ask yourself:

"Should I run a rails command to do this?"

You should run rails commands to:

- Creating/deleting scaffolds, resources, models, views
- Creating & running migrations
- Creating tests
- Other Rails development tasks

You SHOULD NOT run `rails server`. The server will already be started in another terminal.

Example commands:

- rails generate scaffold ModelName attribute:type attribute:type
- rails destroy scaffold ModelName
- rails generate resource ModelName attribute:type attribute:type
- rails destroy resource ModelName
- rails generate model ModelName attribute:type attribute:type
- rails destroy model ModelName
- rails generate migration AddColumnToTable column_name:type
- rails db:migrate
- rails db:rollback
- rails generate controller ControllerName action1 action2
- rails destroy controller ControllerName
- rails generate test_unit:model ModelName
- rails generate test_unit:controller ControllerName
- rails test
- rails routes
